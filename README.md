# Cisco Packet Tracer Project: Hub-Based Network Simulation

## 📁 File: hub-network-simulation.pkt

### 🔧 Description:
This Cisco Packet Tracer file demonstrates a basic LAN setup using a **hub** to connect **five PCs (PC0–PC4)**. The purpose of this simulation is to show how data is **broadcasted by a hub** and how **ICMP (ping) messages** are forwarded between devices.

### 🧪 Features:
- 1 Hub (central device)
- 5 PCs with IP addresses in the same subnet (192.168.10.x)
- Copper Straight-Through cables used for all connections
- ICMP packets (ping) sent to observe packet flow
- Simulation mode tested and verified

### 🎯 Objective:
To visualize how a hub forwards messages to all connected devices, and how only the intended destination responds.

### 📂 How to Use:
1. Download the `.pkt` file
2. Open it in **Cisco Packet Tracer**
3. Run in **Simulation Mode** to observe message forwarding behavior
4. Use the Command Prompt inside any PC to `ping` another PC
